1755,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,The Finnish Immigration Service’s Kamu chatbot is a virtual customer servant that utilises artificial intelligence.
1756,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,You can find Kamu in the lower right-hand corner of the migri.fi website.
1757,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,You can enter your question in either English or Finnish.
1759,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"Kamu offers general advice, but it is not able to answer questions about your personal situation."
1760,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,You should not enter your personal information or other confidential information related to your application in the chatbot.
1761,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,You do not need to log in or register in order to ask Kamu questions.
1762,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"Are you applying for a residence permit, EU registration or citizenship?"
1763,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,Use the Kamu chatbot to check how your application is progressing!
1764,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,Kamu can tell you your application's current place in the processing queue.
1765,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,Kamu checks how many applications in the queue
1766,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,The Kamu service is available in Finnish and English.
1767,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,The diary number does not reveal your identity or any details about your application.
1768,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,It ensures a certain and information secure way to find out how your application is progressing.
1769,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"All applications are processed individually, and an application's position in the queue changes during processing."
1770,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,It is normal to see the position of an application remain the same for a period of time or even fall down the queue briefly.
1771,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,Applications can fall down the queue if pending applications are not processed in the order in which they were submitted.
1772,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"For example, applications submitted by members of the same family are often processed together even if they are not submitted at the same time."
1773,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,The information on an application's progress is updated once a day.
1774,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"While your application’s place in the queue can remain the same for some time or even fall down the queue briefly, it will move forward in the queue over the longer term."
1775,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"Therefore, it is not necessarily useful to ask for a progress update every day."
1776,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"Instead, we recommend that customers check their application's place in the queue once a week or month, for example."
1777,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,Updates on the progress of your application give you an estimate of how many applications in the same queue will be processed before yours.
1778,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"In most cases, we make decisions on applications in the order in which they were submitted."
1779,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"However, processing times vary depending on the type of permit in question."
1780,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,This means that you may receive a decision quickly even if there is a large number of applications in front of yours in the queue.
1781,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"In more than 90 per cent of cases, Kamu can accurately report where a particular application is in the processing queue."
1782,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"However, in particular cases Kamu cannot check where your application is in the queue:"
1783,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"If you have applied for Finnish citizenship, there may be an error when displaying progress updates."
1784,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"Due to the error, your application's position may remain unchanged or fall down the queue for a long time."
1785,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,"If this happens, the information you are currently being shown is not accurate, and your application is actually further down the queue."
1786,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,Your application is processed as normal regardless of its place in the queue.
1787,https://migri.fi/en/chat1,The error is due to a backlog in the processing of citizenship applications.

2826,https://migri.fi/en/-9,إذا طلب في نفس الوقت عددٌ كبيرٌ من مواطنين الدول الثالثة أو الأشخاص بدون جنسية الحمايةَ الدوليةَ، مما يجعل الإجراء صعباً جداً لاتخاذ القرار ضمن المهلة المحددة بستة أشهر؛

2839,https://migri.fi/en/-10,تغییرات در قانون بالای کدام درخواست ها تاثیر دارد؟
2840,https://migri.fi/en/-10,تعهد مربوط به طول پروسه بررسی نمودن درخواست ها پناهندگی که بعد از تاریخ ۲۰/۷/۲۰۱۸ میلادی داده شده است، می باشد.
2841,https://migri.fi/en/-10,پروسه بررسی نمودن درخواست پناهندگی از زمان که درخواست با پولیس و یا سرباز مرز/سرحد ثبت شد، آغاز میگردد.
2842,https://migri.fi/en/-10,تغییرات در قانون به کدام درخواست ها تعلق ندارد؟
2843,https://migri.fi/en/-10,تغییرات در قانون تعلق به درخواست ها پناهندگی که قبل از تاریخ ۲۰/۷/۲۰۱۸ میلادی داده شده است و یا کیس های که از محکه به ریاست مهاجرت برمیگردد، ندارد.
2844,https://migri.fi/en/-10,با درخواست های پناهندگی که قبل از ۲۰/۷/۲۰۱۸ میلادی داده شده است و یا کیس های که از محکه به ریاست مهاجرت برمیگردد، چی می شود؟
2845,https://migri.fi/en/-10,درخواست های پناهندگی که قبل از تاریخ ۲۰/۷/۲۰۱۸ میلادی داده شده است، مدت پروسه بررسی نمودن حداکثرِ۶ ماهه ندارد.
2846,https://migri.fi/en/-10,این درخواست ها در عین زمان با درخواست های که به تاریخ ۲۰/۷/۲۰۱۸ میلادی ویا بعد از آن داده شده است، بررسی میگردند.
2847,https://migri.fi/en/-10,آیا مدتِ بررسی نمودن درخواست های که از ۲۰/۷/۲۰۱۸ میلادی به بعد داده شده است، میتواند بیشتر از ۶ ماه باشد؟
2848,https://migri.fi/en/-10,طبق قانون مدت پروسه بررسی نمودن درخواست های پناهندگی در حالات ذیل میتواند از ۶ ماه طولانی تر باشد:
2849,https://migri.fi/en/-10,تصمیم باید در ظرف ۱۵ ماه گرفته شود اگر:
2851,https://migri.fi/en/-10,قضیه دارای سوالات پیچیده ای از واقعیت یا قانون میباشد.
2853,https://migri.fi/en/-10,تعداد زیادی از اتباع کشورهای سوم یا افراد بدون تابعیت در عین زمان درخواست حفاظت بین المللی را میدهند، و این باعث می شود که تصمیمگیری طی شش ماه تقریباً غیر ممکن باشد.
2855,https://migri.fi/en/-10,علت تاخیرواضعً این است که درخواست دهنده تاثیر مثبت بالای تحقیقات و پیشبرد درخواستش نداشته است.
2856,https://migri.fi/en/-10,اگر درخواست حفاظت بین المللی نیاز به دوره تحقیق طولانی دارد، تحقیقات مناسب و موجه شده و تصمیم با اطمینان باید در ظرف ۱۸ ماه گرفته شود.
2857,https://migri.fi/en/-10,تصمیم به هرحال باید در ظرف ۲۱ ماه گرفته شود در صورتی که در کشور مبدا حالات خراب بوده و از آن سبب تصمیم را نتوانست در طی مدت مشخص شده انجام شود.
2858,https://migri.fi/en/-10,چی باید کرد در صورتیکه پروسه درخواست های پناهندگی به تاریخ از ۲۰/۷ میلادی و یا بعد از آن داده شده است، زیادتر از ۶ ماه طول میکشد؟
2859,https://migri.fi/en/-10,مشتری و یا درخواست دهنده ضرورت ندارد شخصاً با ریاست و یا اداره مهاجرت به تماس شود.

2861,https://migri.fi/en/-10,چی باید کرد اگر پروسه درخواست های پناهندگی که قبل از ۲۰/۷/۲۰۱۸ میلادی داده شده است، طولانی شود؟

2863,https://migri.fi/en/-10,اگر مدت تخمینی بررسی نمودن که مشتری در جریان مصاحبه پناهندگی بدست میاورد طولانی تر شود، در آن زمان میتوان به صفحه اول اینترنتی ریاست و یا اداره مهاجرت مراجعه نموده و از آنجا تقسیم اوقات را ببینید: www.migri.fi

2893,https://migri.fi/en/-11,پرسش های متداول در مورد مدت حداکثر زمان بررسی تقاضاهای پناهندگی
2894,https://migri.fi/en/-11,حداکثر مدت زمان بررسی به چه معنی است؟
2895,https://migri.fi/en/-11,بر اساس قانون جدید، مدت زمان بررسی تقاضاهای پناهندگی که در تاریخ 20/7/2018 و یا پس از آن انجام شده اند حداکثر 6 ماه طول می کشد.
2896,https://migri.fi/en/-11,این تغییر در قانون شامل چه تقاضاهایی می شود؟
2897,https://migri.fi/en/-11,محدودیت جدید مدت زمان بررسی، شامل تقاضاهای پناهندگی می گردد که در تاریخ 20/7/2018 و یا پس از آن انجام می شوند.
2898,https://migri.fi/en/-11,مدت زمان بررسی از وقتی محاسبه می گردد که تقاضای پناهندگی به پلیس یا مأمورین مرزبانی تحویل داده شده است.
2899,https://migri.fi/en/-11,این تغییر در قانون شامل چه تقاضاهایی نمی شود؟
2900,https://migri.fi/en/-11,این تغییر در قانون شامل تقاضاهایی که پیش از تاریخ 20/7/2018 انجام شده اند و نیز پرونده هایی که دادگاه اداری برای بررسی مجدد به اداره کل مهاجرت باز گردانده است نمی شود.
2901,https://migri.fi/en/-11,بر سر تقاضاهایی که پیش از تاریخ 20/7/2018 انجام شده اند و نیز پرونده هایی که دادگاه اداری برای بررسی مجدد به اداره کل مهاجرت باز گردانده است چه می آید؟
2902,https://migri.fi/en/-11,مدت زمان بررسی حداکثر 6 ماه در مورد تقاضاهایی که پیش از تاریخ 20/7/2018 انجام شده اند وجود ندارد.
2903,https://migri.fi/en/-11,با این حال به این تقاضاها همزمان با تقاضاهایی که در تاریخ 20/7/2018 و یا پس از آن انجام شده اند، رسیدگی می گردد.
2904,https://migri.fi/en/-11,آیا ممکن است مدت زمان بررسی تقاضاهایی که در تاریخ 20/7/2018 و یا پس از آن انجام می شوند بیش از 6 ماه باشد؟
2905,https://migri.fi/en/-11,بر اساس قانون، مدت زمان بررسی می تواند در موارد زیر بیش از 6 ماه باشد:
2906,https://migri.fi/en/-11,تصمیم گیری در موارد زیر باید در عرض 15 ماه انجام شود:
2907,https://migri.fi/en/-11,1) پرونده شامل مسائل پیچیده مربوط به واقعیت های موجود یا موضوعات حقوقی می شود؛
2908,https://migri.fi/en/-11,2) تعداد زیادی از توابع کشورهای ثالث یا تعداد زیادی از اشخاص بدون تابعیت بطور همزمان تقاضای حفاظت بین المللی می کنند و به این خاطر بررسی تقاضاها و تصمیم گیری در مورد آنها در مهلت شش ماه عملاً بسیار دشوار می باشد؛
2909,https://migri.fi/en/-11,3) تأخیر انجام شده مشخصاً به این دلیل اتفاق افتاده که متقاضی در بررسی و تصمیم گیری در مورد پرونده اش کمک و همکاری لازم را انجام نداده است.
2910,https://migri.fi/en/-11,در صورتی که انجام تحقیقات مناسب و موجه برای حصول اطمینان از تقاضای حفاظت بین المللی ایجاب کند که زمان طولانی تری برای انجام تحقیقات وجود داشته باشد، تصمیم گیری باید در عرض 18 ماه انجام شود.
2911,https://migri.fi/en/-11,به هر حال در صورتی که شرایط موجود در کشور مبدأ نامطمئن باشد و به این دلیل امکان تصمیم گیری در مدت زمان های فوق الذکر وجود نداشته باشد، تصمیم گیری باید در عرض 21 ماه انجام گیرد.
2912,https://migri.fi/en/-11,اگر مدت زمان بررسی تقاضاهای پناهندگی که در تاریخ 20/7/ و یا پس از آن انجام شده اند بیش از 6 ماه طول بکشد چه باید کرد؟
2913,https://migri.fi/en/-11,نیازی نیست که متقاضی خودش با اداره کل مهاجرت تماس بگیرد.
2914,https://migri.fi/en/-11,اداره کل مهاجرت خودش تأخیر در بررسی پرونده و نیز ارزیابی جدید زمان بررسی را به طور کتبی به متقاضی اعلام می کند.
2915,https://migri.fi/en/-11,اگر ارزیابی زمان بررسی تقاضایی که پیش از تاریخ 20/7/2018 انجام شده است گذشته باشد چه؟
2916,https://migri.fi/en/-11,متقاضی در مصاحبه پناهندگی اش، ارزیابی مدت زمان بررسی برای تقاضایش را دریافت خواهد نمود.
2917,https://migri.fi/en/-11,در صورتی که این ارزیابی زمان بررسی تقاضا گذشته باشد، زمان بررسی تخمینی و قابل انتظار را می توان در صفحه اول صفحات اینترنتی اداره کل مهاجرت با استفاده از محاسبه گر زمان بررسی مشاهده نمود: www.migri.fi.
2918,https://migri.fi/en/-11,مشاور حقوقی متقاضی و کارمند کمپ پذیرش پناهندگی نیز می تواند در صورت لزوم با اداره کل مهاجرت تماس بگیرد.

2945,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Frequently asked questions: Interviewing children
2946,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Why are children interviewed during the asylum process?
2947,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Children have the right to be heard in decisions that affect them.
2948,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,It is in the best interests of a child that his or her opinion is taken into account when such decisions are made.
2949,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Another reason for interviewing children who apply for asylum together with their family is that the children may also have their own grounds for asylum.
2950,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"Under the Aliens Act, the Finnish Immigration Service has an obligation to hear all children over the age of 12 before making a decision that affects them."
2951,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Even a younger child may be heard if the child is sufficiently mature to have his or her views taken into account.
2952,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"In addition, the agency has a principle of hearing all unaccompanied minor asylum seekers regardless of age."
2953,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,What is the interview like?
2954,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"Interviews with children consist of free narrative, meaning that the child can give their own account."
2955,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"In asylum matters, interview is the most important method to find out what a person has to say about their situation."
2956,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"Children are interviewed in the presence of their parents, and the parents can participate in the discussion."
2957,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"In addition to the child and his or her parents, there is also an interpreter and a Finnish Immigration Service employee present at the interview."
2958,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,The Finnish Immigration Service uses trained employees who are specialised in interviewing children.
2959,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"Usually, the interview takes between one and two hours."
2960,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"To make the child feel safe, part of the interview time is used to get to know each other."
2961,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,What is meant by a child’s ‘best interests’ in the asylum process?
2962,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,The ‘best interests’ of a child is a principle of law that must always be followed when the Finnish Immigration Service makes decisions affecting children.
2963,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,The best interests of a child are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis.
2964,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"When a decision is made, the overall situation of the child is taken into account."
2965,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"This includes the child’s personal background, situation and needs."
2966,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"When a best interests assessment is made, several viewpoints are taken into account."
2967,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,The primary criterion is security.
2968,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,A child’s grounds for international protection may be stronger than an adult’s.
2969,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Children may also have their own grounds for asylum independently of their parents.
2970,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,There are also forms of persecution that only affect children.
2971,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"All this, together with the security situation in the child’s home region, is taken into account in asylum decisions."
2972,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"When a child’s best interests are assessed, we take into account the child’s family ties and other close relationships as well as the child’s religious, linguistic and cultural background."
2973,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"Also any individual needs concerning, for instance, the child’s development or health are taken into account."
2974,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,What does the law say about interviewing children?
2975,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"In Finland, provisions on interviewing minors are laid down in the Aliens Act (see section 6 of the Aliens Act)."
2976,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"The Finnish Immigration Service has been conducting separate interviews with all co-applicants who have turned 12, and the agency will keep doing so even in the future."
2977,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,That is a statutory duty.
2978,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,The agency has also interviewed younger co-applicants if it has been deemed necessary.
2979,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Interviewing minors is and has been an important way of assessing what would be in a child’s best interests in his or her situation.
2980,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Children are always interviewed in accordance with their age and maturity.
2981,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,This is a statutory duty laid down in the Aliens Act.
2982,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Why do you interview children whose parents have converted to Christianity?
2983,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"If a child is a member of a religious community, it can affect the child's risk of facing persecution in his or her home country."
2984,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,A person’s religion may constitute grounds for asylum.
2985,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Conversion to Christianity may affect a child's daily life in Finland even when he or she is young.
2986,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"The child may, for instance, have participated in church activities."
2987,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"Naturally, children may be in risk of facing persecution because of other reasons as well."
2988,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"Sometimes, however, these events may have affected the parents in their home country or a long time ago."
2989,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"In such cases, it may not be necessary to interview the children."
2990,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,What is a child able to tell about his or her situation?
2991,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Interviewing a child is necessary if the matter in question affects the child and if the child can be assumed to have information about the matter.
2992,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"In the hearing, the child can be asked for instance about what it means to him or her to be a member of a Christian congregation and what the child’s own opinion about this is."
2993,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,The purpose of asking such questions is to gather additional information about how the child is in risk of persecution.
2994,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"However, the aim is not to use the child's statement against the family."
2995,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,A child’s statement alone cannot determine whether the family is granted asylum or not.
2997,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,What if children say something that contradicts their parents’ statement?
2998,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,A child’s statement cannot be the only factor that determines the outcome of a family’s asylum application.
2999,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"If something exceptional comes up, the agency may later ask the parents about it separately."
3000,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,The purpose of interviewing children is not to use their statements against the family.
3001,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"On the contrary, the aim of the hearing is to see whether the children have anything to add to their parents’ statements."
3002,https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,Children can even have their own grounds for international protection that have not come up before.

3037,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,"Since there is a gap between your residence permits, your period of residence will most likely be considered interrupted."
3038,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,"However, if there is, for example, a health-related reason for the gap, the time that you have lived in Finland without a permit may be counted towards the required period of residence."

3040,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,"In your example, that was 1 March 2015."

3042,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,"Since you meet the language skills requirement, you are required to have lived in Finland for a continuous period of 4 years (continuous period of residence) or for 6 years in total (accumulated period of residence)."

3044,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,Your continuous period of residence is not interrupted by trips that last longer than 2 months but less than 6 months if you have made a maximum of 2 such trips within the last 4 years.

3046,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,"If you have made all the 3 trips during the last 4 years, there has been an interruption in your continuous residence."
3047,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,"In that case, the accumulated period of residence can be used to determine whether you have lived in Finland long enough to qualify for citizenship."
3048,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,"Calculating your accumulated period of residence begins from the day when you moved to Finland, which in your example is 1 March 2015."

3052,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,"In this case, normal holiday trips mean that you may travel for 4 months in total during the whole two-year period."
3053,https://migri.fi/en/faq-finnish-citizenship,Count your accumulated period of residence between 1 March 2015 and the present day.

6619,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,Our system makes an automated decision only where this is possible under law.
6620,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,Automation is based on the rules formulated by the Finnish Immigration Service.
6621,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,These rules are based on law.
6622,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,The system uses these rules to check whether your application meets the requirements laid down in law.
6623,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,See all the requirements for an automated decision on the page Implementation decisions.
6624,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,We take advantage of automation in decision-making and in the processing of applications.
6625,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"For example, applications are automatically directed to different processing paths, which makes the processing more efficient and improves customer service."
6626,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"In addition to automation, the processing of applications and decision-making involve steps taken by authorities."
6630,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,Automated decision-making does not use artificial intelligence.
6631,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,So-called assistive automation has been in use at the Finnish Immigration Service for several years.
6632,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,Assistive automation means that a set of automated rules has been established to help officials verify that an application meets the necessary requirements applicable to the permit in question.
6633,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,A requirement may be automatically marked as met if there is no need for our specialist to assess it.
6634,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"If discretion must be exercised, the requirement is directed to our specialist for examination."
6635,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"Once all the requirements for the application have been met, a draft decision is automatically generated."
6636,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,The draft decision is then validated by our specialist.
6637,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"Even though this type of assistive automation has been in use for several years, introducing fully automated decisions has not previously been possible due to a lack of general legislation on the matter."
6638,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"Now that the current legislation allows automated decisions, the Finnish Immigration Service will gradually start identifying standard cases in different permit processes in which automated decisions could be issued."
6639,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,Standard cases are applications that in the authority’s estimation must always be decided on in the same way.
6640,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,We started using automated decision-making in October 2023.
6641,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"At the moment, you may be granted an automated decision on the following applications in specific cases:"
6642,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,We introduce automated decisions in stages.
6643,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"We first start using automated decision-making in the case of degree students at universities and exchange students in all educational institutions, because their applications rarely require individual assessment."
6644,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,We aim to expand the use of automated decision-making to other standard cases among students’ applications.
6645,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,University students account for approximately 25 % of all students annually coming to Finland.
6646,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"When some of the students receive an automated decision, our specialists can focus their time on the processing of other applications."
6647,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"This way, automated decisions will shorten the processing times of applications from other students as well."
6648,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"Under law, family members cannot receive an automated decision."
6649,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"Therefore, automated decisions are not given to the applicants who apply for a permit at the same time as their family members."
6650,https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation,"However, we take account of the family members who are applying for a permit at the same time as the main applicant and try to issue decisions for them at the same time."

6661,https://migri.fi/en/faq-afghanistan,Expiry of visa is not considered a sufficient ground to request expedited processing.
6662,https://migri.fi/en/faq-afghanistan,The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland is responsible for providing possible assistance to Finnish citizens and foreign nationals residing permanently in Finland while they are abroad.

8172,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,On this page you will find the following forecasts:
8173,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The Finnish Immigration Service’s foresight network consists of experts who meet three times a year to make quantitative and qualitative forecasts about migration to Finland and about asylum seekers arriving in Finland.
8174,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The Finnish Immigration Service makes the projections in cooperation with different interest groups, and is responsible for coordinating the work of the foresight network."
8175,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The network’s operations are directed by an inter-administrative steering group consisting of different authorities.
8176,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The foresight network has updated its forecasts regarding application volumes for 2023 and 2024.
8177,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The forecasts are updated three times a year and published on the website of the Finnish Immigration Service.
8178,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,This page was last updated on 9 October 2023.
8179,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,Number of applications for temporary protection remains high
8180,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The volume of applications for temporary protection has steadily decreased since the spring of 2022.
8181,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,This downward trend has continued during 2023.
8182,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"In 2023, 400 applications have been submitted per week."
8183,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"According to the foresight network's updated projection, 20,000–25,000 applicants for temporary protection arrive in Finland in 2023 (the former forecast was 20,00–30,000 applicants)."
8184,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The year 2024 is expected to see 10,000–15,000 applicants arriving in Finland."
8185,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The number of applicants arriving from Ukraine depends on factors such as:
8186,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"There are considerable uncertainties about the estimated number of applications in 2024, as it is difficult to predict how the war in Ukraine and the resulting refugee situation develop."
8187,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,Number of asylum applications is expected to increase moderately
8188,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The volume of asylum applications in the European Union has been high since 2022 and the numbers have continued to rise in 2023.
8189,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The reasons behind the large application volumes include protracted conflicts in the main countries of origin of asylum seekers and the strained refugee situation within transit countries.
8190,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"In addition, smuggling routes have become more active, which has increased illegal entry into the EU."
8191,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"However, the increase in the number of asylum applications in Europe has not had a major impact on application volumes in Finland."
8192,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The number of applications for international protection started to increase significantly in 2022 with Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the lifting of the restrictions to due to the coronavirus pandemic.
8193,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"In 2023, the application volumes have remained moderate and correspond to the level prior to the coronavirus pandemic."
8194,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The number of first asylum applications submitted in January–August totalled 2,192."
8195,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,There was a marked increase in the number of asylum applications submitted by Russian nationals after Russia declared a military mobilisation in autumn 2022.
8196,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"However, following the imposition of entry and visa restrictions in late September, asylum application volumes declined rapidly and have remained low."
8197,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The possibility of Russian nationals to apply for asylum is limited by the still existing entry restrictions at the border between Finland and Russia, limitations on granting visas, and effective border checks by Russian border authorities."
8198,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The forecast network estimates that the number of first asylum applications in 2023–2024 will be 3,500–4,500 each year."
8199,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The reasons behind the expected increase include prolonged conflicts in countries of origin most relevant to Finland and the strained refugee situation within transit countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Libya."
8200,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"However, the control of the internal and external borders of Europe and the geographical distance between Finland and the key entry routes constrain the increase."
8201,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"However, there may be sudden and unexpected changes in the number of applications for international protection."
8202,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,Number of students coming to Finland has considerably increased
8203,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The period from January to August 2023 saw a record number of first residence permit applications submitted by students, totalling 9,982 applications."
8204,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The forecast network estimates that the number of student applicants will continue to be high.
8205,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The considerable increase in students’ residence permit applications is explained by factors such as amendments to the legislation regarding residence permits for students and researchers, and an increase in international degree programmes and in the intake of students in higher education institutions."
8206,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"In 2023, the estimated number of applications is 13,000, and 14,000 in 2024 (the previous estimates were 8,500 applications in 2023 and 9,000 applications in 2024)."
8207,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The number of applications for a first residence permit depends on factors including
8208,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,Economic downturn is reflected in the number of work-based residence permit applications
8209,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The substantial increase in the number of applications for a first work-based residence permit, which began in autumn 2021, stopped in late 2022."
8210,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"The main reasons were economic downturn and the fact that the number of applications submitted by Russian nationals, which had increased following Russia’s war of aggression, returned to the normal level."
8211,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"In 2023, applications have been steadily submitted, on average 1,400 applications per week."
8212,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"Even though the number of applications has decreased from last year, it is still on a higher level than in 2018–2021."
8213,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"Regardless of economic fluctuations, skills shortages and an ageing population increase the need for foreign labour in Finland."
8214,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,"In 2023, the estimated number of applications is 17,500, and 19,000 in 2024 (the previous estimates were 19,000 applications in 2023 and 21,500 applications in 2024)."
8215,https://migri.fi/en/forecasts,The number of first work-based residence permit applications depends on factors including
8217,https://migri.fi/en/terminated-reception-centers,"Reception services are terminated for asylum seekers who cannot be refused entry and returned to their home country by the police, but who can return to their home country on their own initiative."
8218,https://migri.fi/en/terminated-reception-centers,"Refusal of entry is not possible, for ex-ample, because of a lack of suitable traffic connections to the applicant’s home country or because the applicant’s home country refuses to receive persons who have been forcibly returned."
8219,https://migri.fi/en/terminated-reception-centers,The police inform the reception centre if they are unable to remove a certain person from the country.
8220,https://migri.fi/en/terminated-reception-centers,"After this, the person in question has 30 days to return to his or her home country on their own initiative or apply for assisted volun-tary return."

8352,https://migri.fi/en/old-statistics,The figures on asylum matters in the annual statistics differ from the figures published by Eurostat.
8353,https://migri.fi/en/old-statistics,The reason for this is that Eurostat collects their data on the numbers of applicants on a monthly basis during the statistical year.
8354,https://migri.fi/en/old-statistics,"However, the monthly data is often updated afterwards."
